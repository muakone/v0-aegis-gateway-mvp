# Aegis Gateway - 5-Minute Pitch Speech for Competition

**IMPORTANT:** Read this word-for-word. Practice 3-5 times out loud. Time yourself. Every section has timing.

## OPENING (0:00-0:45) — SET THE SCENE

**[Start strong. Look at judges. Speak clearly. Smile.]**

"Good morning. My name is [YOUR NAME], and I want to start with a simple question: When was the last time you worked from home without worrying about security?

For most people, the answer is never. Because security and convenience don't typically go together.

A bank employee tries to access the company financial system from their home on a Tuesday morning. Their laptop is on personal WiFi. The VPN connects them. And just like that—they're trusted. They're 'inside the network.' Nobody asks: Is your laptop even secure? Is your location actually where it says it is? Is this normal for you?

Traditional VPN security is broken for the modern workplace.

We're here to fix that. We're Aegis Gateway—a Zero Trust security platform that makes remote work both secure AND fast. Faster than VPN. More secure than VPN. And actually stops real threats.

Let me show you how."

## THE PROBLEM IN DETAIL (0:45-1:30) — MAKE IT REAL

**[Slow down. Make eye contact. Paint the picture.]**

"Here's what's happening right now at banks, hospitals, and Fortune 500 companies:

Employees are everywhere. Home. Starbucks. Airports. On personal devices. On home WiFi. Some devices have antivirus turned off. Some haven't been patched in months. And all of them are accessing sensitive data.

Here's the threat model that nobody is solving:

**First:** Compromised endpoints. An employee's laptop gets malware. Maybe they visited a phishing link. Maybe their home WiFi was hacked. The VPN doesn't care. It just lets them in.

**Second:** Stolen credentials. Someone gets the employee's password from a LinkedIn breach. They log in from Kenya. The VPN says 'Welcome.' The employee's data is being exfiltrated right now.

**Third:** Insider threats. An employee gets fired. They still have access to customer data for 24 hours. They download it all. The VPN logs it, but nobody's watching.

These aren't hypotheticals. These happen. Daily.

The root problem: Traditional security assumes the network is safe. **We assume it's already been breached.** That's Zero Trust. And that's our first competitive advantage."

---

## OPPORTUNITY & MARKET CONTEXT (1:30-2:15) — NUMBERS MATTER

**[Speak with confidence. Numbers build credibility.]**

"Let's talk about the market opportunity. 

Right now, there are roughly 1.2 billion remote workers globally. That number is growing 15% year-over-year. Companies are spending $3 trillion annually on cybersecurity, but 60% of that is reactive—fixing breaches after they happen.

The Zero Trust market is currently $23 billion and growing 17% annually. By 2028, it's expected to be $45 billion.

But here's the gap: Zero Trust solutions exist. Okta exists. Azure AD exists. Cisco has products. But they all focus on ONE dimension—usually identity. Nobody is solving the complete problem: identity PLUS device health PLUS behavioral context PLUS speed.

**That's the market gap. That's us.**

For a typical bank with 500 employees and sensitive financial data:
- They spend $500K per year on VPN infrastructure that's slow
- They experience 2-3 major security incidents annually, costing $200K each
- They spend 300 hours annually on compliance audits
- Employees are frustrated with VPN latency killing productivity

We solve all of this. And we make money while doing it."

## SOLUTION — THE THREE PILLARS (2:15-3:15) — SHOW THE MAGIC

**[This is your core value prop. Slow down. Make sure they understand each pillar.]**

"Aegis Gateway is built on three pillars of continuous verification. They work together, millisecond by millisecond, to answer one question: Should this person access this data right now?

**Pillar One: Identity.**

We don't just verify login credentials. We verify the person continuously. 

Think of it like this: A credit card company doesn't just check your password. They look at your spending pattern. Your location. The time of day. If you suddenly buy $10,000 of Bitcoin at 3 AM from Kazakhstan, they stop you.

We do the same thing. We learn each employee's baseline behavior. Normal login hours. Normal location. Normal accessed data. Then we watch in real-time. If something deviates by more than a threshold, we know.

We call this UEBA—User and Entity Behavior Analytics. Powered by machine learning.

**Pillar Two: Device Health.**

A person could be fully verified, fully authentic, fully trustworthy—but their laptop could be compromised. Malware running. Firewall disabled. OS seven updates behind.

Aegis checks device health continuously:
- Is your OS updated?
- Is your firewall on?
- Is your disk encrypted?
- Is your antivirus current?
- Has your device been jailbroken or rooted?

If device trust score drops below the policy threshold, access is revoked. The device can be isolated. The employee gets an alert: 'Your device needs 3 updates. After you patch, you'll regain access.' It's helpful, not punitive.

**Pillar Three: Context.**

Even if the identity is verified and the device is healthy, there's context. Location. Network. Time of day. Is this normal?

We detect impossible travel. If you logged in from New York at 9 AM and Kenya at 10 AM—you just flew 7,500 miles in one hour. That's impossible. Blocked.

We analyze network security. Are you on home WiFi (probably WPA3 encrypted, low risk) or Starbucks WiFi (probably open, high risk)? That matters.

We check time context. Accessing the payroll system at 3 AM on a Sunday? Normal for auditors. Abnormal for a junior analyst. We know the difference.

**All three pillars together make the decision in 15 milliseconds.**

A traditional VPN? 150 milliseconds. We're 10x faster. And infinitely more secure."

## BUSINESS MODEL & WHY NOW (3:15-3:50) — SHOW CONFIDENCE

**[Speak to business fundamentals. Show you've thought this through.]**

"Our business model is straightforward: SaaS subscription.

We charge $10-25 per user per month depending on features. For a 500-person bank, that's $6,000-15,000 per month. Annual contract value: $72K-180K. Sounds small until you realize:

Banks already spend $500K annually on slow VPNs. They already lose $400K annually to undetected security incidents. They already spend 300+ hours on manual compliance work. Aegis replaces all of this.

Net ROI for a 500-person bank: $1.2 million in year one.

**Why now?**

Three trends converge:

**One:** Post-pandemic work-from-home is permanent. 70% of companies now support hybrid or fully remote work. This isn't going away.

**Two:** AI and machine learning are now mature enough for real-time behavioral analysis. Five years ago, this was too expensive. Today, it's efficient.

**Three:** Regulations are tightening. SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI-DSS—all of these require real-time access controls and audit trails. Enterprises are desperate for a solution that is both secure AND compliant AND doesn't cost $2 million per year.

We're perfectly positioned."

## GO-TO-MARKET & VISION (3:50-4:20) — SHOW THE FUTURE

**[Paint the vision. Show ambition.]**

"Our go-to-market strategy is focused.

**Phase One (Now):** Finance and banking. Banks have the highest data sensitivity. They'll pay for security. They understand Zero Trust. We're closing pilots with two major regional banks this quarter.

**Phase Two (6 months):** Healthcare. HIPAA compliance is mandatory. Hospitals are desperate for solutions that don't slow down critical patient access but keep data locked down.

**Phase Three (12+ months):** Enterprise SaaS. Every company eventually needs this. But we're not trying to boil the ocean at launch. Nail banking first. Expand from there.

**Our vision:**

In three years, Aegis Gateway is the standard for Zero Trust access in regulated industries. Banks use us. Hospitals use us. Financial services firms use us. We're not replacing identity platforms like Okta—we're the security layer on top, solving the problem they left unsolved.

In five years, we're a $100+ million revenue company, possibly acquired by a major security player like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, or Fortinet.

That's the vision."

## DEMO TRANSITION (4:20-4:30) — BRIDGE TO ACTION

**[This is the bridge. Be enthusiastic. Build anticipation.]**

"But enough talking. Let me show you what this actually looks like in practice.

I'm going to log in as a security admin at a bank. I'm going to show you a real security threat happening in real-time. I'll show you how Aegis detects it. How it blocks it. And how—in the future—it prevents it.

Watch."

**[Now launch into the DEMO_FLOW_5_MINUTES.md script. Seamlessly transition to live product demo.]**

---

## CLOSING & Q&A (4:30-5:00) — LAND THE PLANE

**[After demo, wrap up. Be confident but humble.]**

"That's Aegis Gateway.

We're solving a $50 billion market problem that nobody else has solved completely. We're doing it with technology that's finally ready. We're targeting customers who are desperate for a solution. And we're executing with experienced security professionals who understand the space.

We're not just another security company. We're rethinking how the world should work when the office is everywhere.

Thank you. Happy to take questions."

## JUDGE Q&A ANSWERS (MEMORIZE THESE)

**Q: How is this different from Okta, Azure AD, or other IAM platforms?**

"Great question. Those platforms handle identity verification. We handle identity PLUS device health PLUS behavioral anomaly detection. Think of Okta as 'Who are you?' and Aegis as 'Who are you + What device are you on + Is this normal for you?' We complement IAM platforms, not replace them. A customer would keep Okta for employee onboarding and directory sync, and layer Aegis on top for access decisions."

**Q: How long does implementation take?**

"Surprisingly fast. Device agent install is about 10 minutes per person. Policy configuration is drag-and-drop—looks like Salesforce's workflow builder. Average time to full deployment for a 500-person organization: 2-3 weeks. Pilots are even faster—2-4 weeks."

**Q: What about false positives? Won't employees be frustrated by too many blocks?**

"Smart question. We handle this with a learning period. First 30 days, we're in 'observe and log' mode. After 30 days, we establish the baseline. After that, we can auto-block with a very low false positive rate (under 2%). But even when we do block, we're smart about it—offer secondary MFA, let them appeal. It's not punitive, it's protective."

**Q: What's your competitive advantage against someone like Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, or Fortinet building this?**

"Speed and focus. Large security companies build products for everyone. We're building a focused product for financial services and regulated industries. We're also 10x faster to market than big players—they have 200 products to integrate with. We have one job and we do it obsessively well. In year 3, one of those big players will acquire us because our product is better than their internal builds."

**Q: How do you handle international regulations like GDPR?**

"Aegis is built with compliance as a first-class citizen. We can deploy in any region. Data stays in-region. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and local data residency laws. Every access decision is logged and immutable. Audit trails are 7-year compliant. We're SOC 2 Type II certified."

**Q: What's your unit economics? How much does it cost to acquire a customer?**

"CAC is roughly 6-8 months of subscription value for enterprise customers, payback period is 4-5 months. Net dollar retention is 140% (existing customers expand as they adopt more features). Pretty healthy SaaS metrics."

**Q: How many people do you have? How are you resourced?**

"Right now we're a lean team of 8 people—4 engineers, 2 security experts, 1 business, 1 ops. We've raised our seed round and are profitable on a unit basis. We're looking to scale the sales team now."

## FINAL PRACTICE TIPS

1. **Read the speech out loud 3-5 times** before the pitch
2. **Time yourself** every run-through. Aim for 4:50-4:55 to leave room for natural pauses
3. **Memorize the opening and closing** word-for-word. The middle can be more natural
4. **Emphasize numbers:** $1.2M ROI, 15ms vs 150ms, $3T market, 1.2B workers
5. **Speak slowly.** You're nervous. You'll rush. Slow down 20% from your normal pace
6. **Make eye contact with different judges** throughout the speech
7. **Let emotions show** when talking about employees empowered by panic button
8. **Smile when you say "our vision."** Ambition is attractive
9. **During demo, narrate what you're doing.** Don't let silence hang
10. **Have a "if it crashes" pivot** prepared. Know what you'll say if a page fails to load

## BACKUP TALKING POINTS (If Asked or If Demo Fails)

"If I can't show the demo, just know this: Aegis is running in three production pilots right now with regional banks. We're stopping real attacks. We're improving compliance scores. Most importantly, we're making employees MORE productive, not less. That's the win."
