## DURING THE PITCH (5-Minute Timeline)

**0:00-0:45** - OPENING (Teammate speaks)
- Set the scene: "When was the last time you worked from home without worrying about security?"
- Problem: VPNs broken for remote work
- Solution intro: Aegis Gateway

**0:45-1:30** - PROBLEM DEEP DIVE (Teammate speaks)
- 3 threat vectors: compromised endpoints, stolen credentials, insider threats
- Market context: $3T cybersecurity spend, 70% remote workforce

**1:30-2:15** - MARKET OPPORTUNITY (Teammate speaks)
- $23B Zero Trust market growing to $45B by 2028
- Your gap: First platform solving identity + device + context

**2:15-3:15** - THREE PILLARS (Teammate speaks + you start demo)
- Identity: Continuous behavioral verification
- Device: Health checks (OS, firewall, encryption)
- Context: Geolocation, network, time, behavior
- All working in 15ms

**3:15-4:20** - LIVE DEMO (You lead, teammate narrates)
- Follow DEMO_FLOW_5_MINUTES.md exactly
- 8-10 pages shown in sequence
- Narrate every click
- Don't let silence hang

**4:20-4:30** - BRIDGE TO CLOSE (Teammate takes back)
- Recap: 10x faster than VPN, prevents real threats, automates compliance

**4:30-5:00** - CLOSING & Q&A PREP (Teammate closes)
- Vision: $100M+ company in 3 years, probably acquired
- ROI: $1.2M annual for 500-person bank
- Thank judges, ask for questions

## IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG (Have These Backups)

**If internet fails:**
- Use backup WiFi hotspot immediately
- Say: "Quick WiFi switch - happens to the best of us"
- Continue with demo

**If a page crashes/doesn't load:**
- Pivot to next page, don't dwell
- Say: "Let me jump ahead to show you the analytics dashboard"
- Have a backup story: "This is running in production with 3 regional banks..."

**If you run short on time:**
- Skip: Device onboarding, advanced analytics details
- Must show: Employee portal, dashboard, attack simulation, three pillars, ROI

**If you're running long:**
- Shorten dashboard explanation (just show KPIs)
- Cut device onboarding entirely
- Skip one analytics page
- You should be done by 4:50

**If demo is going great but you have extra time:**
- Show the compliance automation scores
- Explain a custom policy logic example
- Show integration roadmap if you have one

## JUDGE Q&A - MEMORIZED ANSWERS

**Q1: "How is this different from Okta, Azure AD, or other IAM?"**
"Those platforms handle identity. We handle identity PLUS device health PLUS behavioral analysis. Think of Okta as 'Who are you?' and Aegis as 'Who are you + What device + Is this normal?' We complement IAM, not replace it."

**Q2: "How long does implementation take?"**
"Agent install: 10 minutes per person. Policy setup: drag-and-drop. Average deployment: 2-3 weeks for 500-person org. Pilots even faster—2-4 weeks."

**Q3: "What about false positives? Won't employees get frustrated?"**
"We use a 30-day learning period. After baseline, auto-blocks run at under 2% false positive rate. When we do block, we offer secondary MFA or appeal. It's protective, not punitive."

**Q4: "How do you compete against Cisco, Palo Alto, Fortinet?"**
"Speed and focus. Large companies build for everyone. We focus on financial services first. 10x faster to market. They'll probably acquire us in year 3."

**Q5: "How does this handle GDPR/international regulations?"**
"Data stays in-region. GDPR compliant. CCPA compliant. 7-year audit trail retention. SOC 2 Type II certified. Regional deployments for every major market."

**Q6: "What's your go-to-market? How will you win?"**
"Phase 1 (now): Banks - highest data sensitivity, highest willingness to pay. Phase 2 (6 mo): Healthcare - HIPAA compliance mandatory. Phase 3 (12+ mo): Enterprise SaaS. We're not boiling the ocean. Nail one vertical, expand from there."

- Have detailed competitive analysis
- Have customer testimonials/pilot results
- Have financial model

## REMEMBER

You're not just pitching software. You're solving a **billion-person problem** (1.2B remote workers working insecurely). You're addressing a **$3 trillion market** where 60% of spending is reactive (fixing breaches, not preventing them).

Aegis Gateway is that prevention layer.

Banks know this. They're desperate for it. You're solving their nightmare.

**Deliver with confidence. You've got this.**
